Opposites is a generative art study exploring four universal tensions â€” Chaos, Order, Dark, and Light.

### Concept
This project was an assignment on my Creative Code class in the Digital Design and Development program. Idea was to create 4 scenes that represent the opposite forces. 

### Scenes Overview
#### Chaos

For me Chaos is something raw, full of potential and unpredictable. It's components can be understood but whole picture stays a mystery.

For this scene, I have tried multiple ideas from fractals to cellular automata but with the feedback from my professors, my current knowledge on the subject and time limit, I have decided to go for another direction. My final idea was to create a kaleidoscope.

When designing the sketch, I wanted to use simple shapes and movement in a layered form. One of the things that made this sketch chaotic is that something I have overlooked at first. Instead of using degrees for the rotation I was using radians which made it more unpredictable.

#### Order

My inspiration for the order was a tourbillon. I wanted to create something that work like a clockwork. It represent precision, it does not have any unnecessary movement and it moves as a whole.

#### Light

For this sketch, I wanted to use grayscale and color together to represent our vision in darkness and in light. 

In darkness, we cannot see any movement, only a grid and some idea behind that by the darkness value of the area but in light, we can see that it is alive, it has movement and it has different colors, even though it is same in the darkness.

#### Dark

Dark was the last sketch of all four. I did not really know how to show it at first. I wanted to create a sketch that is dark physically and emotionally. I wanted it to have an uneasy feeling.

My final sketch was a void, moving in a field. Field itself is alive, breathing and reacts to void, making itself smaller when void is near.

### Reflection

Overall it was an interesting and fun assignment and I hope to do more work on this area in the future. I had some ideas for this project and for one reason or another I could not do them but I want to start working on them as soon as possible.

Most of the sketches came alive after many iterations and explorations. They were not the initial concepts but they evolved from that concepts and become something more.
